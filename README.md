Facial emotion recognition has several applications. They could be a biomedical application for measurement of mental health of patients in a hospital setting or measuring the customer’s response and mood while shopping, recognize emotions of employees to measure ‘happiness index’, or whether a user is suffering from ‘depression’ or if the driver of a vehicle is ‘happy’ and ‘cheerful’ enough for a safe driving etc.,

Objectives
The objective of this capstone project is to explore and employ deep learning approaches in order to develop a computer vision model which can accurately detect facial expressions. This can then be used for follow-up applications in the detection of emotion. The goal is to make use of the algorithm to provide a multi-output classification emotion from varying facial expressions.
